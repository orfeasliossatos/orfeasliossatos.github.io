                <p>	When I was in highschool, I braved an applied mathematics class in the dustiest computer room known to man.
                    It was like a dungeon, where photons dared not enter lest they be immediately subsumed by the blinding blaze of the computer screens.
                    Under the watchful eye of a chalk-dust coated old-guard punch-card programmer, we would wield lines of code like swords and wrestle with the nastiest algorithms, in our quest to emerge victorious in the realm of nerddom. </p>
                <p> One fateful Friday afternoon, our professor issued a challenge. "How many configurations of 8 queens on a chessboard are there, where none of the regal ladies can attack each other?". With bonus points on the next test on the line, and a deadline set for Monday, I got to work. Before I reveal how I did it, can you solve the puzzle? </p>

                <p>	The first thing we might want to think about is giving the boot to any configurations that are obviously wrong, like, if all the queens are huddled up in a corner,
                    or standing in a conga line. In other words, we need to invent a rule of thumb that lets us see only the configurations that we care about. </p>
                <p> We can imagine assigning each queen her column, and letting her stand on the first free row from the top. If a whole column is being threatened, then we're stuck and have to remove the last piece placed and move the second-to-last to the next row down. This algorithm is called depth-first backtracking, because we prioritize placing as many queens as possible on the board. Play the animation below to watch how it works.</p>
