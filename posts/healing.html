                <h2>A terrible fate</h2>
                <hr>                
                
                <p>	On my morning walks to work I have time to think. Perhaps the boredom is good for me. I had become somewhat fat, happy, and distracted. What woke me up one night was a strange dream. I was transported back to my childhood apartment in Australia and heard a knock at the front door down the long hallway. I blinked and the door was open. Standing there motionless was a girl I had flirted with a long time ago. Standing next to her was a man, a sort of dream construct made to mock me, an effigy of my insecurity. They merely gazed at me, a child, and then the dream ended. It seemed that something I thought long dead still croaked underneath the surface of my heart's delusion. The shame I felt the following morning for not having moved on from my past emotions was a cold kind of shame. But perhaps something was different this time. </p>
                <h3>How did we get here?</h3>    
                <p>I had already worked through the history. We became close friends after my first breakup. That summer, she sheltered and grew my aborted thoughts, and fed my orphaned sexuality. I had never felt anything so strongly. Our feelings were real and strange and valid. On the day we returned to class, she revealed that she had been struck by lightning: someone else. Then she cast a magic spell: the relationship never really happened. We were en bail, that's all. I tried to play along, but I grew resentful and unkind. Eventually, mutual forgiveness, but the wound remains open until this day. I will perhaps never understand why these events have had such a profound effect on me. </p> 
                <h3>Something to protect</h3>
                <p>Now all that remains is to heal. My darkest, most toxic desire is to reconnect with her, to say everything, to burn it all down, and build something new upon the immense gratitude I still feel for that summer. Today, my chest tightens at the smallest memory of her. I truly want to sublimate that choking into something beautiful, warm, and fuzzy. So I practice. On my walks, she appears around corners, she laughs with her friends across the road, she chats with the baker. I leave her at the front door of the office, and we walk home together in the evening. All the while, I hold onto those positive feelings of friendship. Sometimes I allow myself to feel the familiar knife twist once again. These are my days and nights. I have put off working through this for so long that I wonder if my mind's representation of her being is irreparably connected to this pain. I pray one day I will feel relief.</p>
                <h3>Living in-itself</h3>
                <p>At the end of Outer Wilds, you follow a signal to the eye of the universe, a place where quantum effects are magnified to colossal scale. The eye, preceding the universe itself, is a stand-in for God, and all the stars in all the galaxies are going supernova. God is dying. The eye calls out for a conscious observer to collapse the infinite future possibilities and restart the universe. On a metaphorical level, the player “dies” and is reborn as something else, bringing with them just a handful of good things represented by the different characters you meet in the game. Awareness, gratitude, courage, curiosity, and finally the strength to let go of the past. I was reborn when I decided I was ready to heal. I will be reborn again when I no longer feel the pain. I cannot wait to see how it turns out.</p>
