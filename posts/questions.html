                <p>I have had a few questions bouncing in my mind for a while, I come back to them often as a kind of waypost - to see how I'm progressing.</p>

                <h2>Questions</h2>
                <hr>
                <h3>How do you compress a Lie group?</h3>
                <p>There's something super interesting about skeletal animation compression for real-time applications like game engines and robotics. You want to store an animation file with as few bits as possible, while maintaining the ability to directly run the animation in compressed format. </p>
                <p>I suppose the keyword for this would be something like <i>homomorphic compression</i> for Lie groups.</p>
                <h3>When  does dual quaternion skinning fail?</h3>
                <p>Skeletal animations are fascinating. Every bone in the skeleton is a transformation, and the skin is painted with the strength of each bone on the motion of skin. What's interesting then is that each skin vertex is acted upon by a weighted interpolation of rigid body transformations. Dual quaternions are representation of SE(3) that preserve the interpolation group action better than homogeneous matrices.</p>
                <p>But rigid body transformations are not the end of the story for skeletal animation. Many games make use of scaling on top of rotation and translation. Does it always make sense to linearly interpolate a so-called conformal transformation, or should we be using Conformal Geometric Algebra?</p>
                <h3>What is Quantum Field Theory?</h3>
                <p>What is it? Why do we need it? How are ideas like action and equations of motion derived from the theory?</p>
