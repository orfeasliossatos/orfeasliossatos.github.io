                <ul>
                    <li><b>Raccoon Tycoon</b> | Junk Simulator</li>
                    <p>You are raccoon. Raccoon in city. City full of trash. Raccoon like trash. City pay for trash removal. Raccoon get money. Raccoon spend money, support family.</p>

                    <li><b>Camp Birdsong</b> | Roguelite Murder Mystery</li>
                    <p>A child goes missing during the night. A strange power resets time to the start of camp, giving you a chance to investigate the disappearence. Winning a game of cards forces the loser to answer your questions truthfully. Beating camp challenges nets you stronger cards.</p>

                    <li><b>Hilbert's Nightmare</b> | Mathematical Visual Novel</li>
                    <p>On the edge of a lake in Switzerland is a geometrical anomaly. A large building with no clear inside nor outside. Its walls peel and twist like ribbons, revealing cramped nooks and long bridges between here and nowhere. The monumental institute of mathematics is concrete, chalk, and ink. Every year a hundred or so young students will join the learning programme of their free accord. In this visual novel, we follow Samuel and Vladimir on their journey for personal freedom through mathematical truth. The story is progressed by solving logic puzzles inspired by mathematical analysis, algebra, topology, and geometry. At the same time, the true purpose of the mysterious institute is unraveled.</p>
                    
                    <li><b>Shan  å±±</b> | Massively Collaborative Sculpting</li>
                    <p>It is growing. The collective efforts of thousands of strangers painstakingly sculpting a massive block of digital clay. After twenty-four hours, the sculpture is baked, and recorded forever. The next day, another block of clay appears, and the process starts anew. Seven clay blocks will appear, and then none more. Six editing tools are available, and each day removes a tool. On the final day, the block cannot be touched.</p>
                    
                    <li><b>Hunt</b> | Geometric Horror</li>
                    <p>In the corner of your vision you definitely saw something crawling. In this single-player VR horror game, your imagination fuels your nightmares, as the world geometry warps around you. You live in a Swiss village hidden away in the mountains, where missing children, dead livestock, and rumors of a pact with the devil run wild. Your divine mission is to find the source of evil, and bring about its unholy end.</p>
                
                    <li><b>Yap</b> | Wolf Conlang Simulator</li>
                    <p>What would a wolf language sound like? Players explore a beautiful open world and communicate through a unique lupine voice system. Social activities include hunting, hiking, and simple games such as hide-and-seek. As the game develops, complex activities would require the players to invent richer grammars and vocabulary.</p>
