    "One option is to store the values of $B$ directly, which would take up $|B|\\lceil\\log_2 n\\rceil$ bits in memory. With this option, checking for membership can be accomplished fairly quickly with binary search in $O(\\log n)$ time.\n",
    "\n",
    "But we could potentially save more space by storing $B$'s index in the power set $P(A)$ instead. That is, you store a binary array of length $n$ where the $i$'th bit is 1 if and only if $i\\in B$. You end up with a string like this.\n",
