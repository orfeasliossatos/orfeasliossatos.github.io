            <section>
                <p>I think it's important that I plan often, given that my future appears to change ten thousand times in a single breath.</p>
                <h2>Career</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>I am trying to become a research and development engineer for video games. This is how I see my life playing out in broad strokes at the moment.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>One more year of classes at EPFL.</li>
                    <li>Original research on character animation.</li>
                    <li>An internship at a research institute such as La Forge.</li>
                    <li>Game engine developer based in Switzerland.</li>
                    <li>Return to academia for PhD studies.</li>
                    <li>Teaching position at a meaningful level.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>So maybe I should view my life from each of those future events.</p>
                <h2>Dreams</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>There are the elements that would infuse my life. These are my polar stars.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The study of the material, that from which I am wrought.</li>
                    <li>The study of my self, where awareness begins and ends.</li>
                    <li>The study of the human story, the one that continues in me.</li>
                    <li>The practice of the sword, where my values are tested.</li>
                    <li>The creation of culture, through building and engineering.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If I hold these compasses close and let them guide me I'm certain I will be burn brightly.</p>
                <h2>Star List</h2>
