The brain has spared none from relative proximity 
To the objected sex holding captive masculinity
Who cache and covet indifferent glances
To starved eyes cursed into emerald lances

Pain from want at your mind's behest
Curl up, make room for Envy's nest
Sin breeds strength in chest and wrist
Gothic slaves seek to resist

This polaroid bomb in an alternate wallet
Takes picture-in-picture in cell phone wall locket
Relish in burden, adrenaline trip
Manifest destiny, fuck it, skip

Attention has been confiscated.
Place body on belt for inspection,
Click all stop signs to continue,
Establish mutual connection.

Tell us what you're looking for,
Send your pixels we're starving.
Function, flatmap and filter.
Hook, line and sinker.

Hack the prime factors,
Make your fingers scroll.
Dance for us, practice.
Clothes cut data flow.

Today, I'll depression.
Relieve all the pressure.
Fill in the void with
Tom Nook furniture.
