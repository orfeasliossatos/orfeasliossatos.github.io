                <p>Planning on various timescales. Updated 11th March 2025.</p>
                <h2>Next 3 months</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>I am currently engaged in a master's project on the topic of the inverse design of computer animation. Alongside this, I am head teacher's assistant for Analysis II and taking Optimisation on Manifolds.
                <p></p>
                <h2>Next 12 months</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>I would like to re-spec into game engine programming. As I am specifically interested in animation systems, I will be looking for jobs in the AAA gaming industry or the robotics industry.</p>
                <h2>Next 2 years</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>I would like to continue studying advanced mathematics as a research and development engineer for game engines. In this manner I hope to build more bridges between academia and games research.</p>
